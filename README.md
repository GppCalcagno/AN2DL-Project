# :paperclip: Artificial neural networks and deep learning -Project
This is the repository for the projects of the Artificial neural networks and deep learning course held at [Polimi](https://www.polimi.it/).

2 different project were developed to apply all the topics of the course. For each project a dataset is provided, no external images are allowed. The goal is to train a good-performing network to solve a specific task. An external dataset is used to test the network. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) was used to develop (and train) the networks

### 1) Image Classification Challenge üçÉ
Given a  [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giuseppecalcagno/an2dl-challenge) of plant images (96x96), the goal of the project is to classify them according to 8 classes.

In order to archive the best result and learn the main difficulties of the developing, me and my team decided to follow this steps:
* Convolutional Neural Network from scratch
* Data Augmentation 
* Transfer Learning approach 

üìö A final [report](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/AN2DL-Project/blob/main/Challenge%20%201/Report.pdf) is available in which all the phases of the project are described in detail.

üèÜ At the end of the challenge, we reached an accuracy of 0.914 on the platform test set with our best model

### 2) Time-Series Classification Challenge ‚è±

In this task, we are required to correctly classify among 12 possible labels samples from 6 different time series in the multivariate time series format. The Dataset is available [on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giuseppecalcagno/an2dl-challenge2)

In order to archive the best result and learn the main difficulties of the developing, me and my team decided to follow this steps:
* Conv1D and LSTM Network
* Data Augmentation 
* ResNet Style Architectures 

üìö A final [report](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/AN2DL-Project/blob/main/Challenge%202/Report.pdf) is available in which all the phases of the project are described in detail.

üèÜ At the end of the challenge, we reached an accuracy of 0.7394 on the platform test set with our best model

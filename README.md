# :paperclip: Artificial neural networks and deep learning -Project
This is the repository for the projects of the Artificial neural networks and deep learning course held at [Polimi](https://www.polimi.it/).

2 different project were developed to apply all the topics of the course. For each project a dataset is provided, no external images are allowed. The goal is to train a good-performing network to solve a specific task. An external dataset is used to test the network. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) was used to develop (and train) the networks

### Image Classification Challenge üçÉ
Given a  [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cgz88pri/an2dl-data) of plant images (96x96), the goal of the project is to classify them according to 10 classes.

In order to archive the best result and learn the main difficulties of the developing, me and my team decided to follow this steps:
* Convolutional Neural Network from scratch
* Data Augmentation 
* Transfer Learning approach
